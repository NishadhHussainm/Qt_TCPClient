# TCP Client using Qt in C++

This project showcases a TCP client application built with the Qt framework in C++. It connects to a TCP server to send messages and attachments.

## Overview

The client establishes a connection to the server and allows sending both text messages and file attachments. The UI provides functionality to interact with the server.

## Usage

### Requirements

- **Qt Framework:** Ensure you have Qt installed. You can download it from [Qt's official website](https://www.qt.io/download).

### Building and Running

* Open the project in Qt Creator.

* Build the project by selecting the appropriate build configuration.

* Run the client application.

### Connecting to the Server

The client connects to the server using the local host address and the specified port (8080 by default).

### Functionality

## About
